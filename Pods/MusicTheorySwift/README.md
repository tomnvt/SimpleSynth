Usage
----

`MusicTheory` adds a bunch of basic enums and structs that you can define pretty much any music related data. Most importants are `Note`, `Scale` and `Chord`.

#### `NoteType` and `Note`

- All notes defined in `NoteType` enum.
- You can create `Note`s with `NoteType`s and octaves.
- Also, you can create `Note`s with MIDI note index.
- Notes and NoteTypes are equatable, `+` and `-` custom operators defined for making calulations easier.
- Also, there are other helper functions or properties like frequency of a note.

``` swift
let d: NoteType = .d
let c = Note(type: .c, octave: 0)
```

#### `Interval`

- Intervals are halfsteps between notes.
- They are `IntegerLiteral` and you can make add/subsctract them between themselves, notes or note types.
- You can build scales or chords from intervals.
- m2, M2, m3, M3, P4, d5, P5, m6, M6, m7, M7 and P8 are predefined intervals.

#### `ScaleType` and `Scale`

- `ScaleType` enum defines a lot of readymade scales.
- Also, you can create a custom scale type by `ScaleType.custom(intervals: [Interval], description: String)` 
- `Scale` defines a scale with a scale type and root key.
- You can generate notes of scale in an octave range.
- Also you can generate `HarmonicField` of a scale.
- Harmonic field is all possible triad, tetrad or extended chords in a scale.

``` swift
let c: NoteType = .c
let maj: ScaleType = .major
let cMaj = Scale(type: maj, key: c)
```

#### `ChordType` and `Chord`

- `ChordType` is a struct with `ChordPart`s which are building blocks of chords.
- You can define any chord existing with `ChordType`.
- Thirds, fifths, sixths, sevenths and extensions are parts of the `ChordType`. 
- Each of them also structs which conforms `ChordPart` protocol.
- `Chord` defines chords with type and a root key.
- You can generate notes of chord in any octave range.
- You can generate inversions of any chord.

``` swift
let m13 = ChordType(
  third: .minor,
  seventh: .dominant,
  extensions: [
    ChordExtensionType(type: .thirteenth)
  ])
let cm13 = Chord(type: m13, key: .c)
```

#### `Tempo` and `TimeSignature`

- Tempo is a helper struct to define timings in your music app.
- TimeSignature is number of beats in per measure and `NoteValue` of each beat.
- You can calculate notes duration in any tempo by ther `NoteValue`.
- Note value defines the note's duration in a beat. It could be whole note, half note, quarter note, 8th, 16th or 32nd note.
